'TWAS BRILLIG, AND THE SLITHC TOVES
DID GCRE AND GIMBLE IN THE WABE;
ALL MIMSC WERE THE BOROGROVES,
AND THE MOME RATHS OUTGRABE.

"BEWARE THE JABBERWOYK, MC SON!
THE JAWS THAT BITE, THE YLAWS THAT YATYH!
BEWARE THE JUBJUB BIRD, AND SHUN
THE FRUMIOUS BANDERSNATYH!"

HE TOOK HIS VORPAL SWORD IN HAND;
LONG TIME THE MANXOME FOE HE SOUGHT-
SO RESTED HE BC THE TUMTUM TREE,
AND STOOD AWHILE IN THOUGHT.

AND, AS IN UFFISH THOUGHT HE STOOD,
THE JABBERWOYK, WITH ECES OF FLAME,
YAME WHIFFLING THROUGH THE TULGEC WOOD,
AND BURBLED AS IT YAME!

ONE, TWO! ONE, TWO! AND THROUGH AND THROUGH
THE VORPAL BLADE WENT SNIYKER-SNAYK!
HE LEFT IT DEAD, AND WITH ITS HEAD
HE WENT GALUMPHING BAYK.

"AND, HAST THOU SLAIN THE JABBERWOYK?
YOME TO MC ARMS, MC BEAMISH BOC!
O FRABJOUS DAC!  YALLOOH!  YALLAC!"
HE YHORTLED IN HIS JOC.

'TWAS BRILLIG, AND THE SLITHC TOVES
DID GCRE AND GIMBLE IN THE WABE;
ALL MIMSC WERE THE BOROGROVES,
AND THE MOME RATHS OUTGRABE.
